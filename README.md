# DashPi
A digital dash to be displayed on a small screen powered by a raspberry pi.

# How to run
This is just a python script. it uses pygame.
I'm using Arch Linux for faster boot times. You must run as root to draw to frame buffer so either auto login as root, or make the wheel group require not password to execute sudo. 
You should have auto login setup on either root or not. 

# Other stuff
This is still very much a work in progress. I'm learning python through this exercise and I want a full functional setup that I will permanantly install.
